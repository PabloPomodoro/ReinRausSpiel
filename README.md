# Das alte Rein Raus Spiel
This is and / or will be an HTTP server written in go.
  
The Title is a reference to the movie "A Clockwork Orange",

specifically the line "the ol' in-out, in-out",

which translates to "das alte Rein-Raus-Spiel" in german;

which I thought of as a good title for a HTTP server :)
